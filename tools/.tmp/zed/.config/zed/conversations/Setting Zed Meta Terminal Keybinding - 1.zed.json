Open Zed's command palette with `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux)\n2. Search for \"Open Key Bindings\" and select it\n3. Add the following to your `keybindings.json`:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"context\": \"Editor\",\n    \"bindings\": {\n      \"mod+t\": \"terminal:toggle-terminal\"\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThe `mod+t` mapping will use:\n- Command+T on macOS\n- Alt+T on Windows/Linux\n\n## Notes\n\n- The `mod` key is Zed's abstraction for the platform-specific meta key\n- If the binding conflicts with existing shortcuts, you may need to choose another key combination\n- You can also set a different key if you prefer, like `mod+backtick` (typically written as `` mod+` ``)\n\nIf you need to see all available terminal commands, you can check Zed's documentation or use the command palette to search for \"terminal\".\nmod+t does not appeat to work.\n# Fixing the Terminal Keybinding in Zed\n\nI apologize for the confusion. The `mod+t` binding might not work because:\n\n1. It conflicts with an existing keybinding (possibly for \"New Tab\")\n2. The command name may be incorrect\n\nLet's fix this with a more reliable approach:\n\n## Correct Keybinding for Terminal Toggle\n\n1. Open Zed's command palette with `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux)\n2. Search for \"Open Key Bindings\" and select it\n3. Add the following to your `keybindings.json`:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"context\": \"Editor\",\n    \"bindings\": {\n      \"mod+`\": \"terminal:toggle-panel\"\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThis uses the backtick key (`` ` ``) with the mod key, which is less likely to have conflicts.\n\n## Alternative Options\n\nIf the above doesn't work, try these alternatives:\n\n1. First confirm the exact command name:\n   - Open the command palette\n   - Type \"terminal\" to see all available terminal commands\n   - Note the exact name of the toggle terminal command\n\n2. Try a different keybinding that won't conflict:\n   ```json\n   [\n     {\n       \"context\": \"Editor\", \n       \"bindings\": {\n         \"alt+t\": \"terminal:toggle-panel\"\n       }\n     }\n   ]\n\nIt says it is missing \"working_directory\" for this command.\n# Fixing the Terminal Keybinding in Zed\n\nI see the issue now. The `terminal:toggle-panel` command requires a `working_directory` parameter. Let's update the keybinding with this required parameter:\n\n## Correct Keybinding with Working Directory\n\n1. Open your `keybindings.json` file again\n2. Update it with the following:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"context\": \"Editor\",\n    \"bindings\": {\n      \"mod+`\": [\n        \"terminal:toggle-panel\",\n        {\n          \"working_directory\": \"current_project_directory\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThis sets the terminal's working directory to your current project directory when it opens.\n\n## Alternative Options\n\nIf you prefer a different working directory setting, you can use:\n\n- `\"working_directory\": \"current_file_directory\"` - Opens in the directory of your currently active file\n- `\"working_directory\": \"/path/to/specific/directory\"` - Opens in a specific hard-coded directory\n\n## Verification\n\nTo verify this is working:\n1. Save the keybindings file\n2. Press the keybinding (`Cmd+`` on macOS or `Alt+`` on Windows/Linux)\n3. The terminal panel should toggle open/closed\n\nIf you're still having issues, please let me know the exact error message you're receiving.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":275}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":27},"start":109,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":276}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":28},"start":1136,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":277}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":91},"start":1167,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":278}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":92},"start":2330,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":279}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":258},"start":2391,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":280}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":259},"start":3597,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":281}}}],"summary":"Setting Zed Meta Terminal Keybinding","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}],"thought_process_output_sections":[]}
