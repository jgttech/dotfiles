# Personal Dotfiles Ecosystem

These files are my person utilities and implementations that support my own personal goals, desires, and interests. I make no claim about its usefulness to anyone, except myself.

> Use at your own risk.

## Key Considerations

- Free Open Source Software (FOSS).
- No tracking or telemetry, ever.

# Installation

Run this command to install directly onto your system from the shell script linked to this repo.

> WARNING: Do not blindly install scripts you do not trust. Make sure you trust the source, first.

```bash
TBD
```

# Development

1. Clone the repo.
2. Inside the `bin/install.sh` file:
  - Set the variable to turn on development: `dev=true`
  - This prevents the install scripts from trying to use the real pushed dotfiles code and, instead, looks for local assets only.
